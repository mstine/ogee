h1. Introduction

Ogee provides a module system for Clojure-based applications and libraries. Ogee is based on the OSGi framework and implements an integration layer so that Clojure modules can be deployed into the OSGi framework and interact with it.

h1. OSGi interoperability

* Clojure modules are deployed as normal OSGi bundles
** The OSGi resolver can be used to express certain requirements
** Dynamic deployments and updates of modules
** Modules share their namespaces

* Full access to the service registry
** Modules can register and use OSGi services
** Ogee's service maps provide a natural way for Clojure application to interact with each other
** Java bundles can access service maps

* Due to Clojure's classloading design, the following restrictions apply
** All modules are linked by Ogee and share one Clojure runtime
** Modules can not restrict the visibility of their namespaces
** Namespaces can not be versioned
